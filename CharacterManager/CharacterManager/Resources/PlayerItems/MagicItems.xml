		<ItemName>Alchemy Jug</ItemName>
		<Description>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon
of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.
Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when
it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.
You can use an action and name one liquid from the
table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen
liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action
and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The
maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends
on the liquid you named.
Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce
a different one, or more of one that has reached its
maximum, until the next dawn.
