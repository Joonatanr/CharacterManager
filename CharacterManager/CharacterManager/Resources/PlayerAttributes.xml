		<Description>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around
yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration
spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a
strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on

has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces
the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb
damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a
number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it again
until you finish a long rest.</Description>

		<Name>Tenets Of The Ancients</Name>
		<Description>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns
of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

Kindle the Light. -> Through your acts of mercy,
kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the
world, beating back despair.

Shelter the Light -> Where there is good, beauty, love,
and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness
that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren

Preserve Your Own Light -> Delight in song and
laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in
your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.

Be the Light-> Be a glorious beacon for all w ho live in
despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth
in all your deeds.</Description>

		<Name>Channel Divinity (Ancients)</Name>
		<Description>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.

Nature’s Wrath -> You can use your Channel Divinity
to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action,
you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.
The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While
restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it
frees itself and the vines vanish.

Turn the Faithless -> You can use your Channel
Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey
and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy
symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that
can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while
it is turned.</Description>

all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by
any m eans necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets
are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to
mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The
core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

Fight the Greater Evil. -> Faced with a choice of fighting
my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the
greater evil.

No Mercy for the Wicked -> Ordinary foes might win
my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

By Any Means Necessary -> My qualms can’t get in the
way of exterminating my foes.

Restitution -> . If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is
because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed
by their misdeeds.</Description>
