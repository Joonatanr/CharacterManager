until you finish a long rest.

Major Transformation -> You can transmute one
nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into
another nonm agical object of similar size and m ass and
of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes
handling the object to transform it.

Panacea ->  You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons
affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s
stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.

Restore Life -> You cast the raise dead spell on a
creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without
expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in
your spellbook.

Restore Youth -> You touch the transmuter’s stone to
a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is
reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This
effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.</Description>
