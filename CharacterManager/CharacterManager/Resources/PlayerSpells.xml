    <Description>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose
a door, a window, or an area within range that is no
larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm
alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches
or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you
can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You
also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind
if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping
awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces 
the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</Description>

    <Description>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,
choose one of the following options, the effects of which
last for the duration of the spell. 

While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits
of a different one.

Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an
aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
webbing between your fingers. You can breathe
underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your
walking speed.

Change Appearance. You transform your appearance.
You decide what you look like, including your height,
weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length,
coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a member of another
race, though none of your statistics change. You also
can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you,
and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,
you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for
instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you
can use your action to change your appearance in
this way again.

Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural w eapon of your choice. Your
unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon
you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you
have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
make using it.</Description>

It must see and hear you. If the beast’s Intelligence is

    <Description>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a
message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range,
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
who matches a general description, such as “a man or
woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a
red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak
a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a
flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your m essage
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound
o f your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature
matching the description you gave. If the messenger
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to
where you cast this spell.</Description>

    <Description>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any
number of willing creatures that you can see within
range. You transform each target into the form of a
Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or
lower. 

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
You can choose a different form for each target. 

A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics o f
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
target assumes the hit points o f its new form, and when
it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number
o f hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. 

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its
new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</Description>

    <Description>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
of bones or a corpse o f a Medium or Small humanoid
within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul
mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s
game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action
to mentally command any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). You decide what action the creature will take
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given
it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.</Description>

    <Description>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to
ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being
worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects,
Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets
count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a
creature under your control until the spell ends or until
reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any
creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures,
you can command any or all o f them at the same time,
issuing the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature w ill take and where it will
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general
command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given
an order, the creature continues to follow it until its
task is complete.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points,
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom
are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
locomotion, it instead has a flying speed o f 30 feet and
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius o f 30 feet and
is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its
original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet
of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
piercing damage based on its form.</Description>

The barrier prevents an affected creature from

  <PlayerSpell>
    <Description>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere o f antimagic surrounds
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t
be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even m agic
items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends
suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as magic missile and charm person, that target
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.

Areas o f Magic. The area o f another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area o f magic, the part of
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall o f fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.

Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in it.

Magic Items. The properties and powers of
magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a
nonmagical longsword.
A magic weapon’s properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic w eapon
or a piece o f magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic o f the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel
fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such magical
travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
existence, as w ell as an opening to an extradimensional
space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
summoned or created by m agic temporarily winks out
o f existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.

Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t
nullify each other.</Description>

    <Description>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
You target something within range, either a Huge or
smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.

Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest 
safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 
60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer
frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if
it regains sight o f the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet o f it,
the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
use its movement on each o f its turns to enter the area
or move within reach of the target. When the creature
has done so, it can’t willingly m ove away from the target.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected
creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every
24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect
is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.</Description>

You mentally receive visual information from the eye,
which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.

The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane
of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement,
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1
inch in diameter.</Description>

    <Description>You create linked teleportation portals that remain open
for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that
you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one
point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and p
erpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
faces in a different direction.</Description>

entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You
and the creatures you designate when you cast this
spell can open the object normally. You can also set a
password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,
suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is
impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or
suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses
arcane lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult
to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any
locks on it increases by 10.</Description>

    <Description>You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resembles your m rtal form in
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when
you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one of your
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
companions remain in their astral forms and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to 0 hit points.</Description>

    <Description>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones,
laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
entity about the results o f a specific course o f action that
you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM
chooses from the following possible omens:

-&gt;Weal, for good results
-&gt;Woe, for bad results
-&gt;Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
-&gt;Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting o f additional spells or the loss or gain
of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before
completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
percent chance for each casting after the first that you
get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</Description>

    <Description>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed
on a W isdom saving throw or become cursed for the
duration o f the spell. When you cast this spell, choose
the nature o f the curse from the following options:

-&gt; Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target
has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws
made with that ability score.

-&gt;While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack
rolls against you.

-&gt;While cursed, the target must make a W isdom saving
throw at the start o f each o f its turns. If it fails, it
wastes its action that turn doing nothing.

-&gt;While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells
deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM’s
option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but
it should be no more powerful than those described
above. The DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.</Description>

    <Description>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an 
unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts 
for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking 
the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point
 maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 
26 (+8) and a Dexterity o f 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, 
you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following 
effects with it.

Clenched Fist -&gt; The hand strikes one creature or
object within 5 feet o f it. Make a melee spell attack for
the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target
takes 4d8 force damage.

Forceful Hand -&gt; The hand attempts to push a creature
within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make
a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the
Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is
Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If
you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus
a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting
ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to
remain within 5 feet of it.

Grasping Hand -&gt; The hand attempts to grapple a Huge
or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s
Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is
Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check.
While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a
bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do
so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier.

Interposing Hand -&gt; The hand interposes itself
between you and a creature you choose until you give
the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay
between you and the target, providing you with half
cover against the target. The target can't move through
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or
equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score
is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can
move toward you through the hand’s space, but that
space is difficult terrain for the target.

as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside
a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity
after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
be a younger version o f the same creature. It remains
inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel
remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original
creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided
that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is
physically identical to the original and has the same
personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the
original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical
remains, if they still exist, become inert and can’t
thereafter be restored to life, since the creature’s soul
is elsewhere.</Description>

    <Description>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can
see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or follow the command on its next turn.
The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it
doesn’t understand your language, or if your command
is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You
might issue a command other than one described here.
If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves.
If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach. The target moves toward you by the
shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it
moves within 5 feet o f you.

Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then
ends its turn.

Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from
you by the fastest available means.

Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions.
A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to
do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum
distance needed to remain in the air.</Description>

three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.
You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You
receive a correct answer for each question.
Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you
might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question
pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s
knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be
misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM
might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing
your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
chance for each casting after the first that you get no
answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.</Description>

use a bonus action on each o f your turns to designate a
direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target
must u se as much o f its movement as possible to move
in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action
before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make
another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.

A target isn’t compelled to move into an obviously
deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it w ill provoke
opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.</Description>

    <Description>Choose a spell o f 5th level or lower that you can cast, that
has a casting time o f 1 action, and that can target you.
You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part
of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but
the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it
takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You
describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells.
For example, a contingency cast with water breathing
might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect
when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the
circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you
want it to. and then contingency ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even
if it can normally target others. You can use only one
contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again,
the effect o f another contingency spell on you ends. Also,
contingency ends on you if its material component is
ever not on your person.</Description>

    <Description>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water
inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet
on a side. You can choose from any o f the following
effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your
turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a
different one.

Flood. You cause the water level o f all standing water in
the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes
a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
If you choose an area in a large body o f water, you
instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one
side o f the area to the other and then crashes down. Any
Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends
or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced
a wave, the wave repeats on the start o f your next turn
while the flood effect lasts.

Part Water. You cause water in the area to move
apart and create a trench. The trench extends across
the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to
either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or
you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills
in the trench over the course o f the next round until the
normal water level is restored.

Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area
to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has
to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely
directions. The water in the area moves as you direct
it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes
its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water
continues to move in the direction you chose until the
spell ends or you choose a different effect.

Whirlpool. This effect requires a body o f water
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause
a whirlpool to form in the center o f the area. The
whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet w ide at the
base, up to 50 feet w ide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet o f the
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim
away from the vortex by m aking a Strength (Athletics)
check against your spell save DC.
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes
half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature
caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim
away from the vortex as described above, but has
disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the
vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this
damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</Description>

    <Description>You take control of the weather within 5 miles of  you
for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell.
Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to
the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current
weather conditions, which are determined by the DM
based on the climate and season. You can change
precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 x 10
minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they
do so, you can change the conditions again. When the
spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a
current condition on the following tables and change its
stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you
can change its direction.

    <Description>You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three
corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range.
Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The
DM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each o f your turns, you can
mentally command any creature you animated with
this spell if the creature is within 120 feet o f you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
o f them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). You decide what action the creature w ill take
and where it will move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you have
given it. To maintain control o f the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
before the current 24-hour period ends. This use
of the spell reasserts your control over up to three
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating new ones.

to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within
range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You
can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as
stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no
larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be o f a
form and material that you have seen before.
The duration depends on the object’s material. If
the object is composed o f multiple materials, use the
shortest duration.

Material                         Duration
Vegetable matter            1 day
Stone or crystal               12 hours

Gems                              10 minutes
Adamantine or mithral   1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another
spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, 
the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.</Description>

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a
result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit
point, and the spell ends.

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected
to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without
dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against
the target, and the spell ends.</Description>

    <Description>A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger,
then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range
as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell
ends, either because your concentration is broken or
because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a
low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around
corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere
centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total
accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of
your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage
increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval
has expired, the creature touching it must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends
immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a
successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to
40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the
spell ends, and the bead explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites
flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</Description>

    <Description>You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that
you can see within range. The door is large enough to
allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered.

When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that
appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension,
made of wood or stone. W hen the spell ends, the door
disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the
dem iplane remain trapped there, as the door also
disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new
demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a
demiplane you created with a previous casting of this
spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents
of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by
another creature, you can have the shadowy door
connect to its demiplane instead.</Description>

    <Description>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain
creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of
you. If the creature you ch oose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature
is unaffected

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your attention to another
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the
same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and something that looms large in its mind (such as
som ething it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of
thinking creatures you can’t see. W hen you cast the
spell or as your action during the duration, you can
search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches o f any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.

O nce you detect the presence of a creature in this way,
you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still
be within range.</Description>

desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can
visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance
and direction, such as “ 200 feet straight downward” or
“upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.”

You can bring along objects as long as their weight
doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring
one willing creature of your size or smaller who is
carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature
must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an
object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with
you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to
teleport you.</Description>

    <Description>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor,
weapons, and other belongings on your person—look
different until the spell ends or until you use your action
to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change
your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the
sam e basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent
of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat,
and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches
out to touch you would bump into you while it was
seem ingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC.</Description>

target that you can see within range. The target can be a
creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such
as the wall created by wall of force.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the
target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile
of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life
only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or
smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical
force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation
of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of
it. A m agic item is unaffected by this spell.</Description>

rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using either of the
following special functions.

Break Enchantment -&gt; As your action, you touch a
creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or
possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend,

charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

Dismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack
against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an
undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive
the creature back to its home plane. The creature must
succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to
its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren’t on
their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell,
and fey are sent to the Feywild</Description>

    <Description>You utter a divine word, imbued with the pow er that
shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any
number of creatures you can see within range. Each
creature that can hear you must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an
effect based on its current hit points:

 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
• 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10
minutes
• 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned
for 1 hour
• 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an
elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced
back to its plane of origin (if it isn’t there already) and
can’t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any
means short of a wish spell.</Description>

component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use

    <Description>This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a
creature known to you as the target of this spell. The
target must be on the same plane of existence as you.
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be
contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you
touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger.
While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or
her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the
target’s dreams and can converse with the target as
long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the
spell. The messenger can also shape the environment
of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other
images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it,
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for
the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger
appears in the target’s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger
can deliver a m essage of no more than ten w ords and
then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity
spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target
makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</Description>

• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect,
such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a
small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect
must fit in a 5-foot cube.

• You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a

    <Description>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the
ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
an intense trem or rips through the ground in a
100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
creatures and structures in contact with the ground
in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature’s concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on
the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

Fissures -&gt; Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot w here a fissure opens
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A
creature that successfully saves m oves with the fissure’s
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).

Structures -&gt; The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit
points, it collapses and potentially dam ages nearby
creatures. A creature within half the distance of a
structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher
or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On
a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</Description>

    <Description>You cause a creature or an object you can see within
range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose
either a creature or an object that is neither worn
nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell
has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is w earing and
carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an
affected creature returns to normal size at once.

Enlarge-&gt; The target’s size doubles in all dim ensions,
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth
increases its size by one category—from Medium to
Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the
target to double its size, the creature or object attains
the maximum possible size in the space available.
Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The
target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. W hile
these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with
them deal 1d4 extra damage.

Reduce-&gt; The target’s size is halved in all dimensions,
and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category—from
Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends,
the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks
and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also
shrink to match its new size. While these w eapons are
reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less
damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).</Description>

appears at the point of impact, and the target must

    <Description>You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane,
in the area where it overlaps with your current plane.
You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or
until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During
this time, you can move in any direction. If you move
up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot.
You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but
everything there looks gray, and you can’t see anything
m ore than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and
be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures
that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and
can’t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic
has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the
Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects
you perceive on the plane you originated from.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the
plane you originated from in the spot you currently
occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object
or creature when this happens, you are immediately
shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you
can occupy and take force damage equal to tw ice the
number of feet you are moved.

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on
the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such
as one o f the Outer Planes</Description>

within 60 feet o f you that you can see must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the

to shake the sleeper awake.

Panicked -&gt; The target is frightened of you. On each
of its turns, the frightened creature must take the
Dash action and move away from you by the safest and
shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to
move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away
from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

Sickened -&gt; The target has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can
make another W isdom saving throw. If it succeeds,
the effect ends.</Description>

    <Description>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), 
hawk,lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper),rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. 
Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though 
it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, 
but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. 
A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, 
it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally,
as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind
with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears 
into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. 

As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space
within 30 feet of you. You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you 
already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. 
Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast
it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</Description>

    <Description>You sum m on a spirit that assumes the form of an
unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a
long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied
space within range, the steed takes on a form that you
choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or
a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be
summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the
chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your
choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your
steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence
becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one
language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in com bat and
out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows
you to fight as a seam less unit. W hile mounted on your
steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only
you also target your steed.

W hen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears,
leaving behind no physical form. You can also
dism iss your steed at any time as an action, causing
it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell
again summons the same steed, restored to its hit
point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can
communicate with it telepathically.

You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this
spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed
from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.</Description>

    <Description>This spell allows you to find the shortest, m ost direct
physical route to a specific fixed location that you are
familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you 
name a destination on another plane of existence, a
destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a
destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s
lair”), the spell fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the sam e plane
of existence as the destination, you know how far it is
and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling
there, whenever you are presented with a choice of
paths along the way, you automatically determine which
path is the shortest and most direct route (but not
necessarily the safest route) to the destination.</Description>

    <Description>You sense the presence of any trap within range that
is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this
spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or
unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the
alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap,
but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor,
an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You
don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the
general nature o f the danger posed by a trap you sense.</Description>

    <Description>You create a ward against magical travel that protects
up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30
feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t
teleport into the area or use portals, such as those
created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell
proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore
prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of
the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell,
or the plane shift spell.

In addition, the spell dam ages types of creatures that
you choose w hen you cast it. C hoose one or m ore o f the

W hen a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the

takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice
when you cast this spell).

When you cast this spell, you can designate a
password. A creature that speaks the passw ord as it
enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

The spell’s area can't overlap with the area of another
forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for
30 days in the sam e location, the spell lasts until it is
dispelled, and the material com ponents are consum ed
on the last casting.</Description>

    <Description>An im mobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison com posed of
magical force springs into existence around an area you
choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid
box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on
a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced
1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on
a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter
from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into
or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is
completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures
only partially within the area, or those too large to fit
inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the
area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonm agical
means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or
interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a
Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can
use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or
effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane,
blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.</Description>

being underwater im poses no penalties on the target's
movement or attacks.</Description>

or manipulate objects, and any objects it w as carrying or
holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted
with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.</Description>

    <Description>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you
can see within range to a precise location on a different
plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening,
which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can
orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal
lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where
it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only
by m oving through its front. Anything that does so is
instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in
the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals
created by this spell from opening in their presence or
anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name
of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nicknam e
doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than
the one you are on, the portal opens in the named
creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature
through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side
of the portal. You gain no special pow er over the creature,
and it is free to act as the DM deem s appropriate. It
might leave, attack you, or help you.</Description>

    <Description>You place a magical com m and on a creature that you
can see within range, forcing it to carry out some
service or refrain from som e action or course of activity
as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or becom e
charmed by you for the duration. While the creature
is charmed by you, it takes 5 d10 psychic damage
each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
instructions, but no m ore than once each day. A creature
that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any com m and you choose, short of an
activity that would result in certain death. Should you
issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

You can end the spell early by using an action to
dism iss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish
spell also ends it.

When you cast this spell using
a spell slot o f 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level,
the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells
mentioned above.</Description>

    <Description>You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five
w asps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions
of their natural form s for the duration. A centipede
becom es a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant
spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion
becomes a giant scorpion.

Each creature obeys your verbal com m ands, and
in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM
has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their
actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration,
until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to
dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets.
For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version
might have the sam e statistics as a giant wasp.</Description>

within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected
by such spells.

for each slot level above 6th.</Description>

    <Description>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that
harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as
a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object
that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure
chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the
glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than
10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object
must remain in its place; if the object is m oved m ore
than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph w hen you cast
the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most
typical triggers include touching or standing on the
glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or
manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the m ost com m on
triggers include opening that object, approaching within
a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the
glyph. O nce a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates
only under certain circum stances or according to
physical characteristics (such as height or weight),
creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also
set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those w ho say a certain password.

When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes
or a spell glyph

Explosive Runes-&gt; When triggered, the glyph erupts
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each
creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice
when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a
successful one.

Spell Glyph -&gt;You can store a prepared spell of
3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part
of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect w hen cast in this way. When the glyph
is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a
target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.
If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on
that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures
or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as
close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the
spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its
full duration.

    <Description>A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the
duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you
can see within range. The guardian occupies that space
and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield
emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space
within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a
turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The
creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian
vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.</Description>

    <Description>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet
of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred
5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The
warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you
desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by
dividing the area am ong them, as long as you can walk
into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals
that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that
you choose. You can also specify a passw ord that,
when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.

Guards and wards creates the following effects within
the warded area

Corridors-&gt; Fog fills all the warded corridors, making
them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection
or branching passage offering a choice of direction,
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
the one it chooses.

Doors-&gt; All doors in the w arded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition,
you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent
to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell)
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

Stairs-&gt; Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top
to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards
and wards lasts.

Other Spell Effect-&gt; You can place your choice of one
of the following magical effects within the warded area
of the stronghold.

• Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
guards and wards lasts.
• Place magic mouth in two locations.
• Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors
appear in the places you designate; they return within
10 minutes if dispersed by w ind while guards and
wards lasts.
• Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room .
• Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area
of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters
or passes through the area receives the suggestion
mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel
magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes
only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded
structure by casting this spell there every day
for one year.</Description>

    <Description>You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable
writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that
lasts for the duration.

To you and any creatures you designate when you
cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in
your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended
when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing
appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical
script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause
the writing to appear to be an entirely different message,
written in a different hand and language, though the
language must be one you know. 

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and
the illusion both disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.</Description>

    <Description>You create a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if
you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a
whisper to a scream . It can be your voice, someone
else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair,
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it.
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion
with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
the creature

touch is protected against certain types of
creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey,

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of
those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against
the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened,
or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed,
frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target
has advantage on any new saving throw against the
relevant effect.</Description>

    <Description>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and
lasts for the duration. 

The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound,
smell, or other sensory effects. You can use your action to 
cause the image to m ove to any spot within range. As the 
image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that 
its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if 
you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the
image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image.</Description>

    <Description>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.
Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures
this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of
a point you choose within range are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current
hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls
unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes
damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the
sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from
the total before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal
to or less than the remaining total for that creature
to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed
aren’t affected by this spell.</Description>

    <Description>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet
above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
that you can see within range. The disk remains for the
duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It
can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs,
slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change
o f 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move
across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it
was created at the bottom.
If you move m ore than 100 feet from the disk (typically
because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you),
the spell ends.</Description>
