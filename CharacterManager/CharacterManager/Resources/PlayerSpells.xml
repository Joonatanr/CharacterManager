    <Description>You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose
a door, a window, or an area within range that is no
larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm
alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches
or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you
can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You
also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind
if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping
awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces 
the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</Description>

    <SpellName>Alter Self</SpellName>
    <Description>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,
choose one of the following options, the effects of which
last for the duration of the spell. 

While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits
of a different one.

Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an
aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
webbing between your fingers. You can breathe
underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your
walking speed.

Change Appearance. You transform your appearance.
You decide what you look like, including your height,
weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length,
coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a member of another
race, though none of your statistics change. You also
can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you,
and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,
you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for
instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you
can use your action to change your appearance in
this way again.

Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural w eapon of your choice. Your
unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon
you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you
have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
make using it.</Description>

    <Description>This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no
harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range.
It must see and hear you. If the beast’s Intelligence is
4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must
succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be charmed
by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your
companions harms the target, the spells ends.</Description>

    <SpellName>Animal Messenger</SpellName>
    <Description>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a
message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range,
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
who matches a general description, such as “a man or
woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a
red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak
a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a
flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your m essage
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound
o f your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature
matching the description you gave. If the messenger
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to
where you cast this spell.</Description>
    <AtHigherLevels>If you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell
increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</AtHigherLevels>

    <SpellName>Animal Shapes</SpellName>
    <Description>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any
number of willing creatures that you can see within
range. You transform each target into the form of a
Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or
lower. 

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
You can choose a different form for each target. 

A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics o f
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
target assumes the hit points o f its new form, and when
it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number
o f hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
a result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. 

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its
new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</Description>

    <SpellName>Animate Dead</SpellName>
    <Description>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
of bones or a corpse o f a Medium or Small humanoid
within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul
mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a
zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s
game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action
to mentally command any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can command any or all
of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
each one). You decide what action the creature will take
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general command, such as to guard a particular
chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given
it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.</Description>
    <AtHigherLevels>When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
control over two additional undead creatures for each
slot level above 3rd. Each o f the creatures must come
from a different corpse or pile of bones.</AtHigherLevels>

    <SpellName>Animate Objects</SpellName>
    <Description>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to
ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being
worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects,
Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets
count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a
creature under your control until the spell ends or until
reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any
creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures,
you can command any or all o f them at the same time,
issuing the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature w ill take and where it will
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general
command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given
an order, the creature continues to follow it until its
task is complete.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points,
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom
are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
locomotion, it instead has a flying speed o f 30 feet and
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius o f 30 feet and
is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its
original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet
of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
piercing damage based on its form.</Description>
    <AtHigherLevels>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 
6th level or higher, you can animate two
additional objects for each slot level above 5th.</AtHigherLevels>

radius and moves with you, remaining centered on
you and hedging out creatures other than undead and
constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature from
passing or reaching through. An affected creature
can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach
weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to
pass through the barrier, the spell ends.</Description>

    <SpellName>Antimagic Field</SpellName>
    <Description>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere o f antimagic surrounds
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t
be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even m agic
items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends
suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as magic missile and charm person, that target
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.

Areas o f Magic. The area o f another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area o f magic, the part of
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall o f fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.

Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in it.

Magic Items. The properties and powers of
magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a
nonmagical longsword.
A magic weapon’s properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic w eapon
or a piece o f magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic o f the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel
fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such magical
travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
existence, as w ell as an opening to an extradimensional
space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
summoned or created by m agic temporarily winks out
o f existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.

Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t
nullify each other.</Description>

    <SpellName>Antipathy/Sympathy</SpellName>
    <Description>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
You target something within range, either a Huge or
smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.

Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest 
safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 
60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer
frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if
it regains sight o f the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet o f it,
the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
use its movement on each o f its turns to enter the area
or move within reach of the target. When the creature
has done so, it can’t willingly m ove away from the target.
If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected
creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every
24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect
is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.</Description>

You mentally receive visual information from the eye,
which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.

The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane
of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement,
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1
inch in diameter.</Description>

    <SpellName>Arcane Gate</SpellName>
    <Description>You create linked teleportation portals that remain open
for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that
you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one
point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
and the casting is lost.

The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and p
erpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.

Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
faces in a different direction.</Description>

    <Description>You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other
entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You
and the creatures you designate when you cast this
spell can open the object normally. You can also set a
password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,
suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is
impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or
suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses
arcane lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult
to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any
locks on it increases by 10.</Description>

    <SpellName>Astral Projection</SpellName>
    <Description>You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resembles your m rtal form in
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when
you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one of your
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
companions remain in their astral forms and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to 0 hit points.</Description>

    <Description>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones,
laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
entity about the results o f a specific course o f action that
you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM
chooses from the following possible omens:

-&gt;Weal, for good results
-&gt;Woe, for bad results
-&gt;Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
-&gt;Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting o f additional spells or the loss or gain
of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before
completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
percent chance for each casting after the first that you
get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</Description>

    <SpellName>Bigby's Hand</SpellName>
    <Description>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an 
unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts 
for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking 
the movements of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point
 maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 
26 (+8) and a Dexterity o f 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, 
you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following 
effects with it.

Clenched Fist -&gt; The hand strikes one creature or
object within 5 feet o f it. Make a melee spell attack for
the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target
takes 4d8 force damage.

Forceful Hand -&gt; The hand attempts to push a creature
within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make
a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the
Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is
Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If
you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus
a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting
ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to
remain within 5 feet of it.

Grasping Hand -&gt; The hand attempts to grapple a Huge
or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s
Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is
Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check.
While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a
bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do
so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier.

Interposing Hand -&gt; The hand interposes itself
between you and a creature you choose until you give
the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay
between you and the target, providing you with half
cover against the target. The target can't move through
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or
equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score
is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can
move toward you through the hand’s space, but that
space is difficult terrain for the target.

creature takes 6 d10 slashing damage. On a successful

    <Description>Roll a d20 at the end of each o f your turns for the
duration of the spell. On a roll o f 11 or higher, you
vanish from your current plane of existence and appear
in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is
wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of
your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the
Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of
your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space
you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available
within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied
space (chosen at random if more than one space is
equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear
the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades
of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60
feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other
creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren’t
there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they
have the ability to do so.</Description>

you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails
if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud
could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t
accommodate the cloud).

cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet o f that
point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature

turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call
down lightning in this way again, targeting the same
point or a different one.

cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the
existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under
such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.</Description>

saving throw, choose one o f the following two effects.
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be

suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration
has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about
creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This
indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by
a spell or if it w itnesses any of its friends being harmed.
When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile
again, unless the DM rules otherwise.</Description>

    <SpellName>Disguise Self</SpellName>
    <Description>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor,
weapons, and other belongings on your person—look
different until the spell ends or until you use your action
to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change
your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the
sam e basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent
of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat,
and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches
out to touch you would bump into you while it was
seem ingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC.</Description>

    <SpellName>Find Familiar</SpellName>
    <Description>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), 
hawk,lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper),rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. 
Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though 
it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, 
but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. 
A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, 
it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally,
as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind
with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears 
into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. 

As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space
within 30 feet of you. You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you 
already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. 
Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast
it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</Description>

    <SpellName>Minor Illusion</SpellName>
    <Description>You create a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if
you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a
whisper to a scream . It can be your voice, someone
else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair,
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
things can pass through it.
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion
with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
the creature

    <Description>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and
lasts for the duration. 

The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound,
smell, or other sensory effects. You can use your action to 
cause the image to m ove to any spot within range. As the 
image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that 
its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if 
you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the
image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image.</Description>

Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures
this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of

damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the
sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from
the total before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal
to or less than the remaining total for that creature
to be affected.

    <SpellName>Tenser’s Floating Disk</SpellName>
    <Description>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet
above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
that you can see within range. The disk remains for the
duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It
can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs,
slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change
o f 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move
across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it
was created at the bottom.
If you move m ore than 100 feet from the disk (typically
because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you),
the spell ends.</Description>
